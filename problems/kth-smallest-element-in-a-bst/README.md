# Kth Smallest Element in a BST
[Leetcode page](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/description)

Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k**
th smallest element in it.

**Note:**  
You may assume k is always valid, 1  ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
    **Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
    **Output:** 3
    

**Follow up:**  
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to
find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest
routine?
