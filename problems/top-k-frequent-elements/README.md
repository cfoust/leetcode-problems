# Top K Frequent Elements
[Leetcode page](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description)

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the **_k_** most frequent
elements.

For example,  
Given `[1,1,1,2,2,3]` and k = 2, return `[1,2]`.

**Note:**  

  * You may assume _k_ is always valid, 1  ≤ _k_ ≤ number of unique elements.
  * Your algorithm's time complexity **must be** better than O( _n_ log _n_ ), where _n_ is the array's size.
