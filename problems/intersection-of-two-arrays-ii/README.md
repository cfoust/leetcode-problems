# Intersection of Two Arrays II
[Leetcode page](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/description)

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Example:**  
Given _nums1_ = `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, _nums2_ = `[2, 2]`, return `[2, 2]`.

**Note:**  

  * Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
  * The result can be in any order.

**Follow up:**  

  * What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
  * What if _nums1_ 's size is small compared to _nums2_ 's size? Which algorithm is better?
  * What if elements of _nums2_ are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
