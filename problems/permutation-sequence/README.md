# Permutation Sequence
[Leetcode page](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/description)

The set `[1,2,3,..., _n_ ]` contains a total of _n_! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following
sequence for _n_ = 3:

  1. `"123"`
  2. `"132"`
  3. `"213"`
  4. `"231"`
  5. `"312"`
  6. `"321"`

Given _n_ and _k_ , return the _k_ th permutation sequence.

**Note:**

  * Given _n_ will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
  * Given  _k_  will be between 1 and _n_! inclusive.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 3, k = 3
    **Output:**  "213"
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** n = 4, k = 9
    **Output:**  "2314"
