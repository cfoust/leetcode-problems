# Find the Duplicate Number
[Leetcode page](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description)

Given an array _nums_ containing _n_ \+ 1 integers where each integer is
between 1 and _n_ (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must
exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Note:**  

  1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
  2. You must use only constant, _O_ (1) extra space.
  3. Your runtime complexity should be less than `O(n2)`.
  4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
