# H-Index II
[Leetcode page](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/description)

Given an array of citations **in ascending order** (each citation is a non-
negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the
researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index  _h_
if  _h_  of his/her  _N_  papers have  **at least**   _h_  citations each, and
the other  _N − h_ papers have  **no more than**   _h_ citations each."

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:** citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
    **Output:** 3 
    **Explanation:**[0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
                 received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
                 Since the researcher has 3 papers with **at least** 3 citations each and the remaining 
                 two with **no more than** 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

**Note:  **If there are several possible values for  _h_ , the maximum one is
taken as the h-index.
